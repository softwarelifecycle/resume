# Harold Chattaway Resume

I am a software engineer with extensive experience in .NET and front-end frameworks.. mainly WPF and UWP. I have on large bio-medical device projects ranging from designing the framework for a blood gas analizer for NOVA biomedical, a device for Abbott to guide coronary stent placement and working on a liquid handling robot for HiRes BioSolutions.

I find the bio-medical device space extremely rewarding and fascinating work. I have also been working on using PyTorch to train convolutional neural networks for image processing tasks.

I am highly devoted to continuous learning and have take Udemy courses on Software Architecture, REST API's using rGPC, Python and Data Science.

I look forward to discuss interesting engineering oppurtunities!
