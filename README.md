## Introduction... Full Resume <a href="https://github.com/softwarelifecycle/resume/blob/main/Resume-HaroldChattaway.md">here</a> and above.

I am a software engineer with extensive experience in .NET and front-end frameworks.. mainly WPF and UWP. I have worked on large bio-medical device projects ranging from designing the framework for a blood gas analizer for NOVA biomedical, a device for Abbott to guide coronary stent placement, a liquid handling robot for HiRes BioSolutions and a WPF touch screen app to reverse vision loss for Glaukos. Where possible, I provided links to the various product pages for these applications in my resume.

I find the bio-medical device space extremely rewarding and fascinating work. I have also been working on using PyTorch to train convolutional neural networks for image processing tasks.

I am highly devoted to continuous learning and have taken Udemy courses on <a href="https://github.com/softwarelifecycle/resume/blob/main/SoftArchCertificate.jpg">Software Architecture</a>,<a href="https://github.com/softwarelifecycle/resume/blob/main/AdvancedCSharpCert.jpg">Advanced C#</a> and Python.

I look forward to discussing interesting engineering oppurtunities! 

Thank you for your time.

Harold Chattaway
